# AdobeConnectWrapper
## A Python API wrapper for the AdobeConnect XML API

AdobeConnect is a powerful interactive learning platform that consists of a "learning space" comprised of video conference, chat, virtual whiteboard and file sharing capabilities. 

Basic code hierarchy

- **adobe_connect.py** A very thin wrapper to the Adobe Connect XML API
- **meeting_management.py** A set of higher level abstractions for integrating Adobe Connect into an application.
- **tests.py** Tests covering major classes from both adobe_connect.py and meeting_management.py

*NOTE*: This code was extracted from a larger codebase and there may be some loose ends which would prevent it function as is, but it would be trivial to get it working in it's minimal state.
